# vue-dist-live

This is my first NPM package, this builds vue production applications live as you save your files so you can debug dist files.

## Install
`npm install vue-dist-live --save-dev`

`npm vue-dist-live`

## Run
Open the root directory of the projects.
In terminal run `npm vue-dist-live`
